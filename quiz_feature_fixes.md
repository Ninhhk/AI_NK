# Quiz Generation Feature - Fixes and Enhancement

This patch fixes the quiz generation feature in the AI_NVCB application, which previously only showed output in downloaded text files but not in the frontend interface.

## Fixed Issues

1. **Frontend Display**:
   - Added robust question parsing for both English and Vietnamese formats
   - Improved detection of question patterns for better display
   - Added fallback mechanisms when standard patterns aren't detected
   - Enhanced styling for better readability

2. **Vietnamese Language Support**:
   - Added explicit Vietnamese system prompt to ensure proper language
   - Enhanced detection of Vietnamese question formats ("Câu hỏi")
   - Updated UI text to Vietnamese language

3. **Buggy Question Counter Fix**:
   - Removed the problematic "Questions generated: 10/5" counter
   - Added a filter to remove these metrics from the display
   - Created a more accurate question counting mechanism

4. **Backend Fixes**:
   - Fixed indentation issues in document_service.py
   - Enhanced the quiz template to work better with system prompts
   - Improved error handling and content parsing

## Installation

1. A utility file has been added at `frontend/utils/quiz_filters.py` with functions to filter and clean quiz output
2. A fixed version of document_service.py has been created at `backend/document_analysis/document_service_fixed.py`
3. A script to apply the backend fix is at `fix_backend.py`

## How to Apply

1. Run the fix_backend.py script to safely replace the document_service.py file:
   ```
   python fix_backend.py
   ```

2. In quiz_generation.py, add this import at the top:
   ```python
   from frontend.utils.quiz_filters import filter_quiz_text, parse_quiz_questions
   ```

3. After retrieving quiz_text around line 234, add:
   ```python
   # Filter out noise from quiz text
   quiz_text = filter_quiz_text(quiz_text)
   ```

4. Replace the question parsing around line 246 with:
   ```python
   # Parse questions with enhanced filters
   questions = parse_quiz_questions(quiz_content)
   ```

These changes will ensure the quiz generation feature works properly and displays content correctly in the frontend.

## Notes

- The changes are backward compatible and won't affect the existing API
- All UI text has been translated to Vietnamese for consistency
- The system now enforces Vietnamese language in the quiz output
